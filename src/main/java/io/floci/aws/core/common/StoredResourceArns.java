/**
 * Finds the ARN a service stores a resource under, for a type of the request-resources table whose ARN only that
 * service knows: after the name a request gives ({@code connection/<name>/<id>}), or as all of it, a request naming
 * the resource by members its ARN does not hold
 * ({@code scalable-target/<id>}, named by its service namespace, resource id and scalable dimension;
 * {@code workgroup/<id>}, named by its name). Also the ARNs of the resources a request names through another of its
 * service's own (the cluster or workgroup a Data API session runs on, the cluster an EMR instance group is in, the
 * accounts an IAM Identity Center permission set is provisioned to). Also what a resource's record holds that a
 * request the operation's service forwards as the caller acts on (the key a Redshift snapshot is encrypted with), and
 * the ARN of that resource in the service that owns it (the key, in KMS).
 *
 * <p>The reader asks for every type of the namespace, not only for the ones whose ARN carries an id the service
 * mints, so a service may answer for a type whose ARN it does not mint: a key an alias names is the key the alias
 * points at.
 *
 * <p>Implemented by the service that owns such resources or whose requests name them (EventBridge, for its
 * connections and API destinations; Application Auto Scaling, for its scalable targets; Redshift Data, for the
 * Redshift Serverless workgroups it runs statements on and the targets of its sessions; Payment Cryptography, for
 * the key an alias names; EMR, for the clusters of its instance groups; IAM Identity Center, for the accounts its
 * permission sets are provisioned to; Resource Explorer, for its default view; OAM and RAM, for the sinks,
 * invitations and shares of other accounts they act on); looked up lazily by {@code ResourceArnBuilder} through {@code Instance<StoredResourceArns>}
 * for the namespace a request is of, so IAM never depends on that service directly.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each answer is a lookup of what the service holds, asked for by an entry of the generated table ({@code find},
 * {@code through}, a default, {@code forwarded}): never a fact about what an operation acts on, which the table alone
 * says, from botocore and the Service Reference, or from what AWS says where neither carries it.</p>
